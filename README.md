# PacMan Cabinet Hardware Porting on FPGA KR260

![pacman cabinet](assets/pacman.jpg)

This project is a porting of the original PacMan arcade game hardware to FPGA KR260 using the VHDL code from FPGAArcade, created by MikeJ. The goal of this project is to emulate the original hardware of the PacMan arcade game on the KR260 platform.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:
- sources: contains the VHDL source files of the design
- project: contains the Tcl script to create the Vivado project
- xdc: contains the constraint file for KR260
- roms: contains the open source Pong game ROM compatible with the PacMan cabinet. To get the original PacMan ROM, you can download it online for MAME
- rom-generator: contains a utility program to convert a MAME ROM to VHDL file compatible with emulating the hardware cartridges of this cabinet

## Project Setup

To create the project, open Vivado and run the command "source design_1.tcl". Once the bitstream is generated, you can load it via USB using Vivado onto the KR260.

For VGA output, you can use a PMOD VGA adapter. We have used [this one](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-vga-video-graphics-array/) by Digilent. Connect the PMOD VGA to the PMOD 3-4. The command buttons are mapped in the PMOD 1 [5-6-7-8] and the Switch pins are mapped in PMOD 1 [1-2-3-4].

Before loading the bitstream, make sure that pin 4 of PMOD 1 is set to +3.3V to activate VGA in PAL double scanline compatible mode.

To enable the KR260 to upload the bitstream, run the following commands via XSCT:
- connect
- targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "\*PSU\*"}
- mwr 0xff5e0200 0x0100
- rst -system

If you want to load a different ROM, you must modify the tcl file (project/design_1.tcl) at line 27 with the new ROM directory. If you change this file, you need to recreate the entire project (remove the project/pacman_kr260 directory and re-launch "source design_1.tcl"). In the "rom-generator" directory, there is a bat script for recompiling the entire PacMan rom, called "build_roms_pacman.bat".
